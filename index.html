    <h1>Mocking Bird by Eminem <i class="fa-solid fa-guitar"></i></h1>
    <p class="info-para">
      Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
      When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
      I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
      I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
      <br><br>
      'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
      No more cryin', wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
      We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney
      Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
      <br><br>
      We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
      When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
      Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
      Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
      <br><br>
      I try to keep up sheltered from it but somehow it seems
      The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
      All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
      Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
      <br><br>
      We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
      But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever
      Bein' together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
      But then of course everything always happens for a reason
      <br><br>
      I guess it was never meant to be but it's just somethin'
      That we have no control over and that's what destiny is
      But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
      Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
      <br><br>
      Now hush little baby, don't you cry
      Everything's gonna be alright
      Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
      Daddy's here to hold you through the night
      <br><br>
      I know mommy's not here right now
      And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
      It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
      But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
      <br><br>
      Heh, it's funny, I remember back one year
      When daddy had no money
      Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
      And stuck 'em under the tree
      <br><br>
      And said some of 'em were from me
      'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
      I'll never forget that Christmas
      I sat up the whole night cryin'
      <br><br>
      'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
      But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
      And at the time, every house that we lived in
      Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
      <br><br>
      And your mom, was savin' money for you in a jar
      Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
      Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
      And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your momma's heart
      <br><br>
      And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
      Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so momma moved back
      On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
      And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
      <br><br>
      And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
      And met Dr. Dre and flew you and momma out to see me
      But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
      Then you started seein' daddy on the TV
      <br><br>
      And momma didn't like it and you and Laney were too young
      To understand that papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
      And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
      I'm just sorry, you were there and had to witness it first hand
      <br><br>
      'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
      Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin', lookin'
      At your baby pictures, it just trips me out to see how much
      You both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
      <br><br>
      Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
      Laney, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
      I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
      Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
      <br><br>
      Now hush little baby, don't you cry
      Everything's gonna be alright
      Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
      Daddy's here to hold you through the night
      <br><br>
      I know mommy's not here right now
      And we don't know why, we feel how we feel inside
      It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
      But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
      <br><br>
      And if you ask me to
      Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird, I'ma give you the world
      I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
      I'll do anything for you to see you smile
      <br><br>
      And if that mockingbird don't sing
      And that ring don't shine, I'ma break that birdie's neck
      I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
      And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad, ha ha
